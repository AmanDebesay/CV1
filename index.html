</li>  Above all we are forwarding our warm Franciscan greetings and best wish. We are members, novices, postulates and aspirants of the third secular Franciscan order. Some of us joined the Franciscan fraternity in our country Eritrea. And the others here in Ethiopia Addis Ababa. The reason why we are here in Ethiopia is because of the unstable political condition in our country.
Our temporary residence is Ethiopia it is not stable in its side too. Because of many reasons.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1.</strong> civil war
<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Tribal conflicts
<br>
<strong>3. </strong> Discomfort of working and running ordinary life
<br>
<br>

  <strong>Urgent Cases:</strong>
</ul>
<li>Even though we have many Brothers & Sisters, who are in need of basic needs and shelter (Third country of residence); we also have some who look for urgent help. For example: We have one brother, Ghilazghi Arhe, professed on 25 December 2016, in Asmara/Eritrea, who is married and have two children. In 2015, who had a horrible car accident, broke his leg, which is still not cured. He needs urgent surgery, but doctors recommended him to get to higher specialties in the 1st world country.
He is still suffering, but contributing a lot to his order & church  too. For example: he translated the book "I Francis" &  Encyclical letter of the holy Father Francis "Fratelli Tutti". He is currently preparing to publish a book about the "History of St. Clair"; prepared by him & So on. Since he is Ex-Capuchin, he graduated with higher grade from, Capuchin Franciscan Institute of Philosophy and Theology, Addis Ababa/Ethiopia.
</li>
<br><li>We also have other brother, Mehari Gebregziabher, Married, father of three children. But lost his wife recently; She died, after two weeks of delivering her last baby. He didn't profess, but he is in Candidacy level.</li>
